\label{fig:exchangerstack}
\end{figure}


In this section we would show an example of static analysis using our abstract domain. The fixpoint computation we use is the one defined in \cite{vv2} where thread interfaces (rely-garantee actions) capture relations between relation of thread operations where instead of using thread modular abstract of the state space we use thread interfaces in our abstract domain that capture operation of different threads. We consider the the exchanger stack, which is simply the Treiber's stack~\cite{DBLP:conf/spaa/HendlerSY04} with an exchange mechanism. The code of the exchanger of this stack is given in the figure \ref{fig:exchangerstack}. 
The functions \code{push} and \code{pop} can also write on the stack but we do not consider this part, and we focus on the exchange mechanism.

In this stack, a \code{push} and a \code{pop} can exchange their value without using the stack. If the value of the variable \code{flag} is equal to \code{F} (Final), then a \code{pop} executed by a thread $t$ can change it to \code{W} (Waiting) meaning that it is waiting for exchanging its value with a \code{push}. 
Meanwhile, a \code{push} executed by a second thread $t'$ will detect that the value of the \code{flag} variable is equal to \code{W}, and the \code{push} will change it in \code{C} (Collided) and put its value \code{e} in the variable \code{value}. 
The thread $t$ that execute the \code{pop} can resume its execution and since the value of the flag has changed and is now equal to \code{C} then it resets the flag and returns the value passed by the \code{push}. 

The aim of our analysis is to highlight the dependencies that exist between a push and a pop. For example we will show that for every \code{pop} that returns a value $v$, there exists a corresponding \code{push} that was called with the argument $v$.



\paragraph{Analysis of the init part} 

The library is first call in a sequential mode to be initialized. The initialization step only set the variable \code{E} to its initial value, which means that we will obtain as an initial state for the memory, the state $\{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = 0\}$.


\paragraph{First step of the analysis}

The analysis starts with an empty trace and the initial state for the shared memory discovered in the previous step. We start, for example, by analyzing the \code{pop} function on a thread $t$. We add to the trace the atom $(t, \inv{pop}())$. At line 23, since the abstract state contains the constraint $\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F}$, we analyze the following code and in particular the write of the shared memory at line 24. 
At this point we add an atom at the end of the trace and we modify the abstract state that represents the memory state. Since the shared memory has been written, an action is generated, which is the transition between the previous write on the memory (or the initial state if there is no previous write) and the state after the write on the memory. 
In our case, the action generated is the following:
\[\begin{cases}
	T = \varepsilon\\
	M = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = 0\}
\end{cases} \leadsto
\begin{cases}
	\exists t,\\
	T = (t, \inv{pop}()) \cdot (t, \mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{W})\\
	M = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{W} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = 0\}
\end{cases}\]

If we continue the analysis, we obtain that \code{E.flag} is flipped back to \code{F} because we know in this case that \code{E.flag} is different than \code{C}. At this point we have to generate another action because we have written the shared memory, and then we go back at the beginning of the loop. 
When we apply the widening operator after one iteration in the loop, we get the same abstract state than before the first iteration because:

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{multline*}
\begin{cases}
	T = (t, \inv{pop}())\\
	M = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = 0\}
\end{cases}
\nabla
\begin{cases}
	T =  (t, \inv{pop}())\cdot(t, \mathtt{E.flag=W})\cdot (t, \mathtt{E.flag=F})\\
	M = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = 0\}
\end{cases} \\ =
\begin{cases}
	T = (t, \inv{pop}())\\
	M = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = 0\}
\end{cases}
\end{multline*} 
\end{scriptsize} Then the analysis of the \code{pop} is finished. 

\paragraph{Second step of the analysis}

Now the analysis use another thread $t'$ to analyze a function of the library. We will consider that the function \code{push} is analyzed during the second step. Before the call of the \code{push} function, we have to stabilize with all the possible actions from the other thread. Applying the reduce operation on top of the stabilization give us the following initial abstract state for the \code{push} analysis.
\[\begin{cases}
	T = \varepsilon\\
	M = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = 0\}
\end{cases} \vee
\begin{cases}
	\exists t \\
	T = (t, \inv{pop}()) \cdot (t, \mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{W})\\
	M = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{W} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = 0\}
\end{cases}
\]
At the line 11, the test imposes to refine the abstract state with only the right part of the disjunction, and then we get a new action after the affectations and the return, at the end of the atomic bloc. 
After this first iteration we need to widen with the abstract state got at the end of the loop after the first iteration which is: 
\[\begin{cases}
	T = (t', \inv{push}(\mathtt{e}))\\
	M = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = 0\}
\end{cases}
\]
because the other part of the abstract state was use in the if-then part, and finished with a return. It left only the left part of the initial abstract state that has not changed at the end of the loop.

We get the same abstract value than before the loop after a widening, because we haven't changed anything. This step is finished.








\paragraph{Third step of the analysis} We continue our analysis with another thread $t$. We will analyze for example the \code{pop} function. We can start by stabilizing with all the possible actions which give us the initial state to start the analysis of the \code{pop}.
After the stabilization and the execution of the call of the function, we might have called 1) no function (then \code{E.flag} is equal to \code{F}), 2) only a pop and changed the \code{flag} value to \code{W} or 3) a pop and a push and the value of the flag is \code{C} and the variable \code{value} contains the value of the argument of the push.
To verify the condition at the line 23, it is mandatory that the flag is equal to \code{F}. In this case, only the 1) in the abstract state verifies this condition. 

When the analysis reaches the line 25, the atomic bloc is finished and we can stabilize with all the possible actions. The action 
\begin{scriptsize}
\[\begin{cases}
	\exists t_1, \\
	T_1 = (t_1, \inv{pop}())\cdot (t_1, \mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{W}) \\
	M = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = 0\}
\end{cases} 
\leadsto
\begin{cases}
	\exists t_1, t_2,\\
	T = T_1 \cdot (t_2, \inv{push}(e_{t_2})) \cdot (t_2, \mathtt{E} = \{\mathtt{W}, e_{t_2}\})\\
	M = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = e_{t_2} \wedge e_{t_2} = \top\}
\end{cases}
\] \end{scriptsize}
can be applied now if we suppose that $t_1 = t$. It is the only abstract value that does not verify the condition at line 27. With this abstract value, we generate a new action at line 31, that we can complete with the return that directly follow the write in the global memory. 

After one iteration of the loop, we need to widen with our operator $\nabla$. Like in the first iteration, the traces have increased with irrelevant atoms. The widening operation will reduce our traces to remove them and to obtain, like in the first step, a stable abstract value. 


\paragraph{Next steps} Up to this point we have partially prove what we wanted to obtain, \emph{i.e.} the trace
\begin{multline*}
T = (t_1, \inv{pop}())\cdot (t_1, \mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{W}) \cdot (t_2, \inv{push}(e_{t_2})) \cdot (t_2, \mathtt{E} = \{\mathtt{W}, e_{t_2}\}) \\
\cdot (t_2, \ret{push}{1}) \cdot (t_1, \mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F}) \cdot (t_1, \ret{pop}{e_{t_2}})
\end{multline*}
that highlight that the input value of the push is returned by the pop. But the analysis is not finished because the trace might increase infinitely. 
But as we have designed the stabilization operation, this issue will not happen. In our case, if we consider for example the trace $T_0$ defined above, we observe that the abstract memory after the execution of $T$ is equal to $M = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = \top\}$ and the abstract memory after the execution of the empty trace $T_0$, is simply the memory in the initial state, which corresponds to $M_0 = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = 0\}$. Then we have $M_0 \sqsubseteq M$, and after the reduction, we get the following abstract state:
\[
\begin{cases}
	T = \varepsilon\\
	M = \{\mathtt{E.flag} = \mathtt{F} \wedge \mathtt{E.value} = \top\}
\end{cases}
\]

The analysis will restart with this new abstract value. We will get the same results than previously, with the initial value containing $\mathtt{E.value} = 0$, but with a more general beginning value. The analysis will finish with this new abstract value as an initial state.

\bigskip

Finally, we have proved the property we wanted, which was that for every \code{pop} that returns a value there exists a \code{push}, and the value returned by the \code{pop} was an input parameter of the \code{push}. This property can directly be read on the final traces we obtain when the analysis is finished. This example shows how our abstract domain can be used to prove properties on a concurrent data structures that uses cooperation between threads. Other data structures can be analyzed with this abstract domain, like the Java's exchanger.
